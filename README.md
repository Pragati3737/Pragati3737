I'm Pragati, a professional data analyst with experience on more than 13 technical projects. My skills include business analytics, data visualization and storytelling, Python, SQL, and ML. Now, I am eager to leverage my big data and visualization skills in the media & communications sphere to drive growth and boost sales.




As a Data Analyst Apprentice at Triple Ten , I am gaining hands-on experience in data analytics fundamentals and problem solving. I have completed multiple projects using real-world datasets and presented my findings to stakeholders from the community.

As a seasoned Quality Assurance professional with over 6 years of experience, I specialize in ensuring seamless software functionality and user satisfaction through meticulous testing and analysis. 

Proficient in tools like JIRA, HP Quality Center, and Postman, I have honed my ability to create and execute test cases, identify and resolve defects, and contribute to robust CI/CD pipelines. My technical toolkit also includes knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and experience testing SOAP and RESTful web services.

Beyond my QA expertise, I bring a unique perspective from my current role as a Preschool Teacher, where I have cultivated adaptability, communication, and an innate ability to work collaboratively—skills that seamlessly translate into the tech world. This blend of technical and interpersonal capabilities positions me as a versatile professional ready to tackle complex challenges with a solutions-oriented mindset.
